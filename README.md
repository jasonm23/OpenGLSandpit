# OpenGL Sandpit

Basic starting points for coding OpenGL in a variety of languages. Starting with C on Win32 and Mac OS X.

Samples for Ruby, python, perl and perhaps others to follow.

## Initial sample 

- opengl_win32.cpp (compile with Visual C++ Express, requires references to glu32.lib & opengl32.lib)

A simple test render that opens a win32 Window and renders a red square in an OpenGL View.
